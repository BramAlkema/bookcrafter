# Part I: Getting Started

## Chapter 1: Introduction

This is sample content. Replace this with your book's content.

BookCrafter uses a simple 4-file markdown structure:

- **FrontMatter.md** - Cover, title page, copyright, dedication
- **Content.md** - Your main chapters (this file)
- **Backmatter.md** - Bibliography, glossary, about the author
- **Decisions.md** - Non-printable editorial notes

### Writing in Markdown

You can use standard markdown formatting:

- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for titles or foreign words
- Lists for organizing information

> Blockquotes work great for highlighting important passages.

## Chapter 2: Your Story

Continue writing your content here. Each `##` heading becomes a new chapter.

### Section Headings

Use `###` for section headings within chapters.
