# Product Mission (Lite)

BookCrafter is an open-source Python-based book production system that helps self-publishers create professional PDF and EPUB books from a simple 4-file markdown workflow, without requiring expensive commercial tools.

BookCrafter serves indie authors and open source advocates who want professional typography (dot-leader TOCs, running headers, custom fonts) without the $250+ cost of Vellum or ongoing Atticus subscriptions. Unlike documentation tools that output basic PDFs, BookCrafter produces publication-ready books with proper front matter, back matter, and CSS Paged Media support.
